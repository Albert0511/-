###### Problem 1

During an economic depression, it is common for food prices to increase even as incomes decrease. Surprisingly, however, researchers determined that during a depression, for every 5 percent increase in the cost of bread, the lowest socioeconomic class actually increases the amount of bread purchased per capita by 3 percent.

<u>Choices:</u>

Which of the following hypotheses best accounts for the researchersâ€™ findings?

- [ ] Not all food costs increase during a depression; some food items actually become less expensive. 
- [ ] Because bread consumption does not increase by the same percentage as the cost does, people are likely consuming more of  other food items to compensate.
- [ ] When incomes decrease, people are typically forced to spend a larger proportion of their income on basic needs, such as food and housing.
- [ ] People who suddenly cannot afford more expensive foods, such as meat, must compensate by consuming more inexpensive foods, such as grains.
- [ ] During a depression, people in the lowest socioeconomic class will continue to spend the same amount of money on food as they did before the depression began.

<u>Wrong Answer:</u> **E**

<u>Correct Answer:</u> **D**

<u>Explanation:</u>

Consider the equation that represents the consumption habits $\rm Cost_{bread} \ + \ Cost_{Expensive} \ = \ Income$ (assume people spend all income on food). Now, we are given the condition that people's income reduces during the economic crisis which is equivalent to the equation. $\rm Income' \ \le \ Income$. Furthermore, we could describe the cost as $\rm Cost_{bread} \ = \ Price_{bread} \ \cdot \ Amount_{bread}$. In the findings, the phonemon that for every 5 percent increase in the cost of bread, the lowest socioeconomic class actually increases the amount of bread purchased per capita by 3 percent could be translated into equation $\rm Price_{bread}' \ > \ Price_{bread} \ \and \ Amount_{bread}' \ > \ Amount_{bread}$. This implies that $\rm Cost_{bread}' \ > \ Cost_{bread}$.

Now, we translated the **E** choice: it asserts that $\rm Income' \ =  \ Income$. However, in the condition, we only have $\rm Income' \ \le \ Income$. The conditions are not sufficient to come to the conclusion. 

Now, we translated the **D** choice: it asserts that $\rm Cost_{Expensive}' \ < \ Cost_{Expensive}$. This is true because $\rm Cost_{Expensive}' \ = \ Income'\ - \ Cost_{Bread}' \le \ Income \ - \ Cost_{Bread} \ = \ Cost_{Expensive}$.
